        <p> Wild hunt heathcliff is one if not the coolest Heathcliff Identities in Limbus company. He is also Heathcliff's bad end Id that's a alternate version of erkling heathcliff. This Id's whole story changes after the events of his story or also known in game as canto, the story beforehand involves him reminiscing on past events of his "umbrella" or Catherine who was the only reason he had stayed at the manor </p>
